      <p>There are several main topics that Michael speaks on.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>All these topics are based upon the latest scientific research. Michael spends at least 30 days a year reading journal articles and books to ensure the workshops are based on the latest information.<br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Suicide Prevention in the Workplace</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>Suicide does not just happen to teenagers in school. It is far more common to people who are working. Workplaces are ideally situated to play a key role in suicide prevention.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>All his workshops are based on the latest scientific research. Michael presents the material in an interesting, informative and hopeful way that anyone can understand. Michael provides everything from one-hour gate keeper training for all staff to full day seminars for managers to look at improving well-being in the workplace.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>Many employers were nervous about raising the topic of suicide within the workplace. Not one single company Michael has worked for has ever regretted their decision to cover this. The feedback from staff is always that they are very grateful for this.<br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Mental Illness</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>Research strongly suggests that mental illness is increasing in New Zealand. Many employers are finding themselves overwhelmed by the high numbers of mental illness in the workforce. Michael provides seminars to help people understand what mental illness is, the right and wrong things to say to someone and how to help someone.<br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Overcoming Failure</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>This is Michael's signature talk that he did his TEDx talk on.<br/><br/></p>
