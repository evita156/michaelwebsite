      <p>There are three main seminars and workshops that Michael offers.<br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Overcoming a Fear of Failure</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>Is your sales team not selling? Are you stuck in a rut? Is the competition passing you by? Is your business not where it should be?<br/><br/></p>
      <p>There are many reasons for this. But, failure or fear of failure may be the reason why this is happening. Fear of failure may stop a sales person reaching high value customers because they don&#39;t want to be rejected, or your business from trying new and innovative ideas.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>In the seminar Michael shares his person story of overcoming failure to inspire your team to overcome their fear of failure. <br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Preventing Stress and Burnout</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>Are you experiencing high staff turnover?<br/><br/></p>
      <p>Are your staff slow and unmotivated?<br/><br/></p>
      <p>There can be a multitude of reasons for this, but more often than not it is caused by burnout because of how busy and stressful the modern workplace is.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>Michael uses tried and tested research to help staff become more productive, feel more relaxed and avoid burnout. This is suited to almost every industry.<br/><br/></p>
      <p>Michael has spoken to doctors, accountants, lawyers, builders and many more about this topic.<br/><br/></p>
      <p><b>Understanding Mental Illness in the Workforce</b><br/><br/></p>
      <p>Mental illness affects about 1 in 6 employees. The World Health Organisation listed depression as the leading cause of disability and productivity loss in the world. Mental illness can be stressful for managers and costly for businesses. There are ways to reduce the chances of a staff member developing a mental illness. This funny and thought provoking talk will be of benefit to almost every industry.<br/><br/></p>
